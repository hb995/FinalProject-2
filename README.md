## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:  
  - SwiftUI for the user interface.  
  - [ActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/exyte/ActivityIndicatorView) for loading animations.  
- **APIs**:  
  - TMDb API for fetching real-time movie data.

## üìê Architecture  
The app follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture for scalability and maintainability.  

### **ViewModel Classes**  
- **`Constants.swift`**: Centralized management of API keys and URLs.  
- **`MovieDetailsViewModel.swift`**: Fetches and processes detailed movie information.  
- **`HomeViewModel.swift`**: Manages data for the home screen.  
- **`MovieSearchViewModel.swift`**: Handles search functionality and updates.  
- **`RecommendationViewModel.swift`**: Generates personalized recommendations.  

### **Model Classes**  
- **`Movie.swift`**: Defines movie properties such as title, genres, and release date.  
- **`Genre.swift`**: Represents movie genres for filtering.  
- **`DiscoverResponse.swift`**: Manages paginated movie data from API calls.  

### **View Classes**  
- **`HomeView.swift`**: Main navigation interface.  
- **`FeaturedMoviesView.swift`**: Carousel for featured movies.  
- **`MovieDetailsView.swift`**: Displays detailed information about a selected movie.  
- **`SearchView.swift`**: Real-time search interface.  
- **`MoodSelectorView.swift`**: Recommends movies based on mood selection.  
- **`WelcomeView.swift`**: Initial setup for user preferences.
